# SEM-2-FINAL-SPRINT
Simple read me explaining a few things

If not seen already I will be attaching my videos through teams as they ended up being too big to attach here.

All images used for this project were obtained from a royalty free source, these images are used to attempt to resell parodies of an already existing product. 

The react project will need the node modules installed because for the life of me I could not get them to push to github. 


The code for the portfolio project can be found in the branch called portfolio.
